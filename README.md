# trajectory_tracking
This is a ROS application to test trajectory tracking algorithms for mobile robots using Gazebo as simulator.
The robot that has been used for this project is [Turtlebot 2][1] which is an affordable mobile robot widely used for research.
People who are interested can test these algorithms in a real robot.

The algorithms that have been used so far are:
* Numerical method controller using Euler's approximation.
